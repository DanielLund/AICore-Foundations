### Practical 1 - Temperature Class

- Create a Temperature class that has a constructor that takes
  a temperature in Celsius and stores it as an attribute.
- Add a method to convert the temperature of the instance to
  Fahrenheit
- Add a static method that converts the temperature from
  Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Add a static method that check if a temperature is valid
  (ie. between -273 and +3000)
- Add a class method that creates a new instance of the
  Temperature class given a temperature in Fahrenheit
- Add a class method named standard that creates a new
  instance of the Temperature class with a value of 0 Celsius
- Make the temperature attribute a property than can be set,
  get and deleted
- Use the dataclass decorator to substitute the constructor
